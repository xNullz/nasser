											Solar Winds</a> are streams of

											from the upper atmosphere of the 
											Sun. They consist of electrons, 
											protons, and other ions that are 
											expelled from the Sun at high 
											speeds, typically around 400 km/s. 
											Solar winds are a natural phenomenon

											A Denial of Service (DoS) attack is 
											a type of cyber attack in which a 
											malicious actor seeks to make a 
											network or computer resource 
											unavailable to its intended users. 
											This is typically accomplished by 
											flooding the target with traffic or 
											requests for connections, 
											overwhelming the resources of the 
											network or server and making it 
											unable to respond to legitimate 
											requests.<p>There are several 
									methods that can be used to carry out a DoS 
									attack. Some of the most common include:</p>
									<ol>
										<li>Ping flood: This involves sending a 
										large number of ping requests to a 
										target, with the goal of overloading the 
										server and making it unable to respond 
										to legitimate requests.</li>
										<li>SYN flood: This type of attack 
										involves sending a large number of SYN 
										requests (a type of packet used to 
										initiate a TCP connection) to a target, 
										with the goal of exhausting the target's 
										resources and making it unable to 
										respond to legitimate requests.</li>
										<li>HTTP flood: This involves sending a 
										large number of HTTP requests to a 
										target, with the goal of overwhelming 
										the server and making it unable to 
										respond to legitimate requests.</li>
										<li>DDoS attack: A Distributed Denial of 
										Service (DDoS) attack involves using a 
										network of compromised computers (called 
										a &quot;botnet&quot;) to flood a target with 
										traffic. This type of attack is 
										particularly difficult to defend 
										against, as it can involve traffic from 
										many different sources.</li>
									</ol>
									<p>It is important to note that DoS attacks 
									can be difficult to defend against, as they 
									often involve a large volume of traffic and 
									can be difficult to trace to their source. 
									However, there are a number of measures that 
									organizations can take to protect against 
									DoS attacks, such as implementing network 
									firewalls and load balancers, and using rate 
									limiting and traffic filtering techniques.</p>

									A man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack is a type 
									of cyber attack where an attacker intercepts 
									and manipulates communication between two 
									parties who believe they are communicating 
									directly with each other. In an MITM attack, 
									the attacker is able to &quot;sit in the middle&quot; 
									of the communication and can alter, 
									intercept, or block messages between the two 
									parties.<p>MITM attacks can take many forms 
									and can be difficult to detect, as the two 
									parties may not realize that their 
									communication has been compromised. Common 
									techniques used in MITM attacks include 
									interception of unencrypted communication, 
									the use of spoofed IP addresses, and the use 
									of malicious software or hardware to 
									intercept communication.</p>
									<p>MITM attacks can be highly successful, as 
									they allow the attacker to gain access to 
									sensitive information and potentially 
									compromise the security of the two parties 
									involved in the communication. It is 
									important for individuals and organizations 
									to be aware of the risks associated with 
									MITM attacks and to take steps to protect 
									themselves, such as by using encryption and 
									implementing strong security measures.</p></div>

											A honeypot is a security tool that 
											is used to detect and defend against 
											cyber attacks. It is essentially a 
											trap set up to lure in attackers, in 
											the hope that they will reveal 
											themselves and their tactics while 
											interacting with the honeypot.<p>
											There are different types of 
											honeypots, ranging from 
											low-interaction honeypots that are 
											designed to collect information 
											about potential attackers and their 
											tactics, to high-interaction 
											honeypots that are designed to 
											closely mimic a real network or 
											system and capture as much 
											information as possible about the 
											attackers and their methods.</p>
									<p>Honeypots are often used as part of a 
									larger security strategy, as they can help 
									organizations to detect and defend against 
									attacks, gather intelligence about potential 
									threats, and understand the tactics and 
									motivations of attackers. They can also be 
									used to distract attackers and divert their 
									attention away from more valuable resources.</p>
									<p>One important thing to note about 
									honeypots is that they should not be used as 
									the primary means of protecting a network or 
									system. They should be used in conjunction 
									with other security measures, such as 
									firewalls and intrusion detection systems, 
									in order to provide a comprehensive security

									<p style="text-align:justify">Nmap is a 
									security auditing tool used in the security 
									field to actively enumerate a target 
									system/network. It is one of the most 
									extensively used tools by network 
									administrators and conversely attackers for 
									reconnaissance (enumeration), the first step 
									in the 5 phases of hacking. Nmap is used to 
									actively probe the target network for active 
									hosts(host discovery), port scanning, OS 
									detection, version details, and active 
									services running on the hosts that are up. 
									For this, Nmap uses the technique of sending 
									packets and analyzing the responses. To 
									learn more about please refer to the article
									<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/nmap-scans-for-cyber-security-and-penetration-testing/">
									Nmap</a>.</p>
									<p style="text-align:justify">Port Scanning 
									is one of the features of Nmap wherein the 
									tool detects the status of the ports on 
									active hosts in a network. The status of the 
									ports can be open, filtered, or closed. Type 
									Nmap in the command line to run Nmap. Add 
									necessary switches according to the scanning 
									type to initiate a specific scan technique.&nbsp;</p>
									<blockquote>
										<p style="text-align:justify">Example: 
										nmap -sS 192.168.0.1-192.168.0.52 &nbsp;</p>
									</blockquote>
									<p style="text-align:justify">This command 
									runs Nmap in TCP SYN scan type (-sS) and 
									scans the given IP address range for active 
									hosts and services.</p>
									<p style="text-align:justify">Please refer 
									to the article
									<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/port-scan-in-ethical-hacking/">

									<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Types 
									of Port Status:</strong></h3>
									<ul>
										<li style="text-align:justify"><strong>
										Open</strong>: The open status means 
										that the given port is open and is 
										actively running a service.</li>
										<li style="text-align:justify"><strong>
										Filtered</strong>: The filtered status 
										means that the respective port might be 
										hidden behind a firewall and its status 
										remains unknown.</li>
										<li style="text-align:justify"><strong>
										Closed</strong>: The closed state 
										represents a given port is closed on the 
										host machine.</li>
									</ul>
									<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>
									Different Port Scanning Techniques in Nmap</strong>:</h3>
									<p style="text-align:justify">The following 
									are the extensively used scanning techniques 
									in Nmap:&nbsp;</p>
									<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>1. TCP 
									Connect Scan</strong> <strong>(-sT)</strong>: 
									TCP Connect scan uses the concept of a full
									<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tcp-3-way-handshake-process/">
									three-way handshake</a to discover whether 
									a given port is open, filtered, or closed 
									according to the response it receives. Nmap 
									sends a TCP request packet to each and every 
									port specified and determines the status of 
									the port by the response it receives. RFC 
									793 says,</p>
									<blockquote>
										<p style="text-align:justify">If the 
										connection does not exist (CLOSED) then 
										a reset is sent in response to any 
										incoming segment except another reset. 
										&nbsp;In particular, SYNs addressed to a 
										non-existent connection are rejected by 
										this means.&nbsp;</p>
										<p style="text-align:justify">What it 
										essentially means is that if Nmap sends 
										a TCP request to a closed port with its 
										SYN flag set, then it receives a TCP 
										packet with its RESET FLAG set from the 
										target server. This tells Nmap that the 
										specified port is closed.&nbsp;<br>
										Otherwise, if the port is actually open, 
										then Nmap receives a response with SYN/ACK 
										flags set responding to the packet sent 
										by Nmap with its SYN flag set.&nbsp;<br>
										The third possibility is that if a port 
										is filtered, most of the server's 
										firewalls are configured to just drop 
										incoming packets. Nmap doesn't receive 
										any response back. This essentially 
										means that the given port is running 
										behind a firewall filtered.</p>

								<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>2. TCP SYN 
								Scan (-sS)</strong>: SYN scans are often called 
								&quot;Half-open&quot; or &quot;Stealth&quot; scans. SYN scan works 
								the same way as TCP Connect scan with closed and 
								filtered ports i.e receives a RST packet for 
								closed port and no response for filtered ports. 
								The only difference is in the way they handle 
								the open ports. SYN scan sends a response packet 
								to the server with its RESET FLAG set(but not 
								ACK which is usually the default in the actual 
								three-way handshake) after receiving SYN/ACK 
								from the target server. This is to avoid the 
								server from continuously making requests to 
								establish a connection and thereby reduce the 
								scan time.</p>
						<p style="text-align:justify">This scan type is referred 
						to as a stealth scan due to the following advantages:</p>
						<ul>
							<li style="text-align:justify">Faster because it 
							doesn't have to complete the full three-way 
							handshake.</li>
							<li style="text-align:justify">Some applications 
							often log only those connections that are fully 
							established. So applications listening on open ports 
							do not log these connections which makes SYN scan 
							&quot;stealthy&quot;.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
						<img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20220704173234/sysscan.png" width="712" height="411"></p>
						<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>3. UDP Scan (-sU):
						</strong>UDP unlike TCP, doesn't perform a handshake to 
						establish a connection before sending data packets to 
						the target port but rather sends the packets hoping that 
						the packets would be received by the target port. That 
						is why UDP connections are often called &quot;stateless&quot;. 
						This type of connection is more efficient when speed 
						dwarfs quality, like in video sharing. As there will be 
						no acknowledgment from the target port whether it has 
						received the packet, UDP scans become more difficult and 
						very much slower.&nbsp;</p>
						<ul>
							<li style="text-align:justify">When there's no

							<li style="text-align:justify"><strong>TCP NULL Scan

							closed, the host responds with an RST.</li>
							<li style="text-align:justify"><strong>TCP FIN Scan 
							(-sF): </strong>FIN scan, rather than sending 
							completely empty packets, it sends a packet with its 
							FIN flag set. If the port is closed, the host 
							responds with an RST.&nbsp;</li>
							<li style="text-align:justify"><strong>TCP XMAS Scan 
							(-sX): </strong>XMAS scan, sends a packet with 
							URG,PSH,FIN flags set. This scan got its name from 
							the appearance it gives of a Christmas tree when 
							viewed as a packet capture in Wireshark. If the port 
							is closed, the host responds with an RST.</li>

											The cyber kill chain is a model that 
											describes the stages of a cyber 
											attack, from the initial 
											infiltration of a target system to 
											the exfiltration of sensitive data. 
											The cyber kill chain was developed 
											by Lockheed Martin and is used as a 
											framework for understanding and 
											defending against cyber attacks.<p>
											The seven stages of the cyber kill 
											chain are:</p>
											<ol>
												<li>Reconnaissance: The attacker 
												gathers information about the 
												target system and its defenses.</li>
										<li>Weaponization: The attacker creates 
										a payload (e.g., malware or ransomware) 
										to deliver to the target system.</li>
										<li>Delivery: The payload is delivered 
										to the target system, often through 
										phishing or other social engineering 
										tactics.</li>
										<li>Exploitation: The payload exploits a 
										vulnerability in the target system to 
										gain access.</li>
										<li>Installation: The payload installs 
										itself on the target system, often 
										disguising itself to avoid detection.</li>
										<li>Command and control: The attacker 
										establishes a connection to the payload, 
										allowing them to remotely control the 
										compromised system.</li>
										<li>Actions on objectives: The attacker 
										carries out their objectives (e.g., 
										exfiltrating data or disrupting 
										operations).</li>
									</ol>
									<p>Understanding the cyber kill chain can 
									help organizations and individuals identify 
									the different stages of an attack and take 
									action to prevent or mitigate the impact of 
									the attack.</p>
